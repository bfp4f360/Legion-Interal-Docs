The strategy for weapons is that for each faction you pick a baseline weapon.
This weapon will be used as a reference point for all other weapons. This weapon
will most likely be the main weapon of that faction. For example Dc-15a for
republic, E-5 for CIS, E-11 for Empire and A-180 for Rebels. Now with in each
faction theres weapon groups. 

For example, the `Republic main weapon group` might be  
(DC-15a, Dc-15s, Z6, DC-15 LE, DC-15 mod 0)  
Lets also say that the `CIS main weapon group` is
(E-5, E-5c, E-5s, E-5 magna)

These two weapon groups would be balanced within them selfs(so 15a would be like
medium to long range, while the 15s is ment for short range) and with each other
(E-5c would be compared to z6, E-5 compared to 15a/15s, E-5s to LE)

Now heres where it really kicks in, lets say there are two other groups for the
republic are `Commando` and `Airborne` for example. 

Lets say the `Airborne` group is  
(DC-15c, DC-16 suppressed,DC-15L)  
and lets say the `Commando` group is  
(DC-17m, DC-17m Sniper, DC-17m AT)

The idea behind this is you would balance weapons within their groups and to
their faction counter parts. So you balance the `republic main group` within it
self and to the `CIS main group`, then you compare the `Republic Airborne` to `CIS Airborne`.

The reason for this is that there really isnt enough variation between the
different parameters weapons can have. having 5 weapons is hard to make then
have a niche and complement each other, now imagine having more. You would have
overlap and some weapons would flat out not be used. With this system you can allow for some overlap(Like 15c might be better damging then 15s but 15s has better rof, but they both are carbines) while still having variation.
