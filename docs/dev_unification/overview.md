I have some ideas for stuff and I will just lay it out here.

## Overall mentality

So its easier to set relationships between stuff rather then the actualy values.
For example its easier to say person A is taller then person B but its harder to
quantify that value since you would have to measure it and heights can
change(growth or just wear heels). This gives people the freedom to then define
the values they need, while also having a reference to what the other values of
other stuff should be.
