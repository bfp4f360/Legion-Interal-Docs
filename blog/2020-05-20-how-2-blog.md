Hello heres a summary of how I structured the repos!

<!--truncate-->

:::note In the beginning there was nothing
And the wowe said, let there be yeet, and the yeet was good
:::

These are the 3 main repos

## Legion-Base and Legion-Armory
`Legion-Base` and `Legion-Armory` share the same structure as they are both mods. They look like this
![image](/static/img/blogs/struc.PNG)

- `_keys` is the private/public keys people need to key the server. **Remember to never give out the private key**. Generally you make a new private/public key pair for each new verision of the mod.
- `_src` is the mod it self, inside it has the `\addons` folder, the `meta.cpp` and `mod.cpp` files.
- `_utils`, short for utilities, would be any helper stuff, for example `Legion-Base` might have a
  bash script that builds the entire mod for you, or maybe there is a SQF to help with testing something.

## Legion-Utils

The structure looks as follows

The idea behind this repo is that it serves more as an "archive" to store used/or soon to be used assets. There might be more catagories in the future but these are the 4 that I could come up with.

## Why all this?

:::caution RANT TIME!!
time for a big ole rant!

So all of this is based off a few key past experiences

1. I have a B.S in Computer Science, documenation and orgnization is like 30% of the work
2. I ran a star wars mod for atleast 500+ people **by my self, F, rip, help
   me**. Over the time I found out what helps make things easier to sort and run.
3. This doc site is cool.
